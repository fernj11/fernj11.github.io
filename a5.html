        <p><strong>Q1:</strong> This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet: https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdf. What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?</p>
        <p>Depending on temperature from 25 to 100 degrees Celcius the continuous current ranges from 29.8A to 37.2A. However the maximum current from the schematic is 80A.</p>
        <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.</p>

        <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293D. Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.</p>

      <p>For the code you have initialize the several different pins that are used by the chip and what motors they will be controlling. From there a function is created to move the appropriate motor to get the desired function of movement. In the loop we then call the different functions: both forward, both backward, then one forward and the other backward and vice versa.</p>
