      <p>Schematic of the red LED. There are three separate for the three LEDS, however they have the same design. They are connected to their respective ports, then go to a 220 ohm-resistor, which then goes through the LED to ground.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Calculation of resistance needed. There is five volts available but the red LED uses 1.8 volts leaving 3.2 volts available. Using the equation pictured above we can calculate the resistor needed using the 3.2 volts available and desired current of 20mA. Leaving 160 ohms so we use the 220 ohm resistor.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <p>
          <strong>Q1:</strong> Draw a graph where the X-axis is time and the Y-axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.
        </p>
        <img src="a1_graph.jpg" alt="Graph of voltage vs. time for LEDs" />
      </div>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Q2:</strong> How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
      </p>
      <p>There are 14 ports on the Arduino that could be used to blink independently, but the limit of the Ardunio board is 200mA
         and if we attempt for 20mA per light then we can calculate that it would be safe to have 10 LEDs at a time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q3:</strong> How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </p>
      <p>
        I began to lower the amount of time between blinks until it was at 3 milliseconds. At this point, I couldn't determine if the lights were blinking or not.
