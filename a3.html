      <p>Schematic and resistance of the LED and button. There are separate calculations for the LED and sensor.</p>
      <p>For calculations of the resistance needed. There is five volts available but the red LED uses 1.8 volts leaving 3.2 volts available. Using the equation pictured above we can calculate the resistor needed using the 3.2 volts available and desired current of 20mA. Leaving 160 ohms so we use the 220 ohm resistor. For the sesnor it would be a slightly different calculation because there is a max of a 5 voltage drop instead.</p>
      <p>For the motor it was different because it used a capacitor unlike the others and was based on the Ardunio site.</p>

      <!-- <div class="grid"> -->
        <p>
          <strong>Q1:</strong> In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.
        </p>
        <img src="a3_q1.jpg" />
        <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
        <img src="a3_graph.jpg" alt="Graph of voltage vs. time for voltage" />
      <p><strong>Q3:</strong> AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</p>
      <!-- </div> -->
      <p>If we used 10-bit PWM and 16-bit analog-to-digital then the parameters of the map() would be much larger. With more bits we are able to store and use more data, more so in the way that the readings would be more precise. This in turn would make the parameters larger because of the precision. With the 10-bit we had a range of 0-1023, but with a 16-bit we would have a range of 0-65535.</p>
