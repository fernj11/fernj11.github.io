      <p>Schematic and resistance of the LEDs and button. There are separate calculations for the LEDS, however they have the same design. They are connected to their respective ports,
         that go to a 220 ohm-resistor with the exception of 100 for the blue LED. After the LED to complete the circuit it goes to ground.</p>
      <p>For calculations of the resistance needed. There is five volts available but the red LED uses 1.8 volts leaving 3.2 volts available. Using the equation pictured above we can calculate the resistor needed using the 3.2 volts available and desired current of 20mA. Leaving 160 ohms so we use the 220 ohm resistor. This would also work for the green LED as it uses the same amount of volts as the red. For the blue it would be a slightly different calculation because there is a 3.3 voltage drop instead.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Q1:</strong> Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).
        </p>

        <img src="a2_problem.jpg" alt="Graph of voltage vs. time for LEDs" />
        <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
      <p>For this calculation you have to split it up into the blue LED, separate from the red and green LED. From there the calculation for the current is done, and because of the fade you can take the average of the current. From there you divide the 1200mAh by the current averages of the LEDs.</p>
